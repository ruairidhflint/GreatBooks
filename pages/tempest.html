        <p>
          I haven't read any Shakespeare since school and even then it was
          limited to Macbeth and Hamlet. It was surprisingly readable,
          especially with the notes provided in the Penguin edition. I did
          briefly reference a 'plain English' translation but once I begam to
          get into the flow of the language it was no longer necessary.

          It is, of course, meant to be viewed as a theatrical performance as
          opposed to being read but it was nonetheless still very enjoyable. In
          addition to the text, I watched the 2017 production by the Royal
          Shakespeare Company which was excellent.
