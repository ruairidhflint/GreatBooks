    <p>
      In many ways I was disappointed but I was let down my own expectations not
      the quality of the book. I picked up the Penguin version with a selection
      of essays as opposed to the whole collection. There were many that were
      enjoyable but I found myself skipping through some of the prose and not
      really taking in the full essay.
