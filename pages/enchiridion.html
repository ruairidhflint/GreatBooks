        <p>
          Alongside Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and Seneca’s letters this
          feels like the commandments of Stoicism. I have many thoughts on
          Stoicism; primarily positive but also some disagreements that are very
          apparent in the Enchiridion.

          I originally read the translation by P.E. Matheson from 1916 which was
          solid. In addition, I read a much more modern translation by Stephen
          Walton from 1997. It seemed a little ridiculous in parts where he had
          tried <i>too</i> hard to modernise the text but largely was a helpful
          accompaniment.
