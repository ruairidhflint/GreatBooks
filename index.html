    <h4>
      Currently reading Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky - <em>Last Updated on 1st April 2023</em>
    </h3>
  </h4>
      I reflected recently that, while being a lifelong avid reader, I have both
      intentionally and unintentionally missed some of the most important texts
      ever written.
    </p>
    <p>
      While browsing in a large bookshop recently, I was struck with the common
      sadness that I will never read all of these books. I will never read even
      1% of them. Later that day, I listened to a podcast by Naval Ravikant in
      which he said something along the lines of,
      <em
        >“I don't want to read all the books; I just want to read the best 100
        over and over again.”</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      What a thought. Only a small fraction of books are remembered after a few
      years, and even fewer truly matter. Why, then, am I worried about not
      being able to read a large number? My primary concern should be ensuring
      that the books I read are worthy of my limited time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project has been evolving in my mind for a while and has been inspired
      by:

    <p>
      My intention over the coming years is to read and study these Great Books
      and document the process along the way. I aim to, as the Graham School
      puts it,
      <em
        >“rigorously explore the foundations of modern Western political and
        social thought and literature.”</em
      >
    </p>

      The structure below is split into years as per a traditional education
      program. Realistically these serve as neat delineations rather than actual
      expected timeframes.
